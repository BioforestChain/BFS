## Quick Start

1. Run `deno task dev` in the terminal.
   > This will fetch subprojects, download dependencies, and auto-generate some files.
1. If you are an iOS developer, open [./next/kmp/app/iosApp/DwebBrowser.xcworkspace](./next/kmp/app/iosApp/DwebBrowser.xcworkspace) in Xcode and set up the necessary signing configurations.
1. Open Android Studio; once Gradle synchronization is complete, you can start coding happily.
